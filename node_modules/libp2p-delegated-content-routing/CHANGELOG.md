# [0.5.0](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/compare/v0.4.5...v0.5.0) (2020-04-23)


### Chores

* make ipfs-http-client a peer dependency ([#39](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/issues/39)) ([0c0f304](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/commit/0c0f304))
* remove peer-info from api ([#34](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/issues/34)) ([2c97221](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/commit/2c97221))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The ipfs-http-client must now be installed
as a peer dependency. It is no longer included as a dependency
of this module.

The reason the http-client should be a peerDependency and
not a dependency is that its API requires knowledge of the
http-client (we pass in the api endpoint details).
* findProviders returns id and addrs properties instead of peer-info instance

* chore: address review
